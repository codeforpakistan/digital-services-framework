# Code of Practice

**The Technology Code of Practice is a set of criteria to help government design, build and buy technology.**

You should use the Technology Code of Practice for all of your technology projects or programmes. Consider each point, align your project or programme with the mandatory points, and follow as many of the remaining points as is practical. You will get the most benefit by aligning your organisation's technology and business strategies to the Technology Code of Practice.

Following the Technology Code of Practice will help you introduce or update technology so that it:

- meets user needs, based on research with your users
- is easier to share across government
- is easy to maintain
- scales for future use
- is less dependent on single third-party suppliers
- provides better value for money

The Technology Code of Practice contains guidance and case studies to help you migrate from legacy infrastructure and manage the full lifecycle of your technology.

## [Define user needs](/guides/user-research)
Understand your users and their needs. Develop knowledge of your users and what that means for your technology project or programme.

## [Make things accessible and inclusive](/guides/accessibility)

## [Be open and use open source](/guides/open-source)
Publish your code and use open source software to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability.

## [Make use of open standards](/guides/open-standards)
Build technology that uses open standards to ensure your technology works and communicates with other technology, and can easily be upgraded and expanded.

## [Use cloud first](/guides/cloud-first)

Your technology should work with existing technologies, processes and infrastructure in your organisation, and adapt to future demands.
