# Digital Services

**Technologies you can use when building and running government services**

- [Rehnuma](./rehnuma/) is an [API gateway](https://rehnuma.kpgov.tech) that sits between the citizens and backend services provided by each department. It acts as the primary aggregator and transformer for G2G and G2C services and provides a number of functions ranging from authentication to caching, throttling, and monitoring.

- [Pehchaan](./pehchaan/) is the [digital identity](https://pehchaan.kpgov.tech) of the citizens of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is an [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) implementation for use as centralized authentication and authorization mechanism for accessing government services. Citizens sign up for a digital identity ONCE, and use the same identity across all government services. 

- [Paighaam](./paighaam/) allows government departments to communicate with the citizens through a unified omni-channel [communication gateway](https://paighaam.kpgov.tech). This system greatly simplifes messaging and provides a communication platform for sending emails, text messages, and push notifications with ease.
